Step 1: Measure & Set Goals

    1. Malware - by allowing employees yo use their own devices for work, it creates a risk with how they use their persona device in their free time like if they click suspicious links or download files from unknown senders, it can be brought back to the company’s network.

Data Theft - having employees use their devices on unsecured networks, it leaves the company’s information at risk to anyone who might be intercepting an unsecured network.

Insider Threat - having sensitive data at the palm of their hands opens up the door for employees to end up as insider threats, whether they have malicious intent or not, by having habits that follow over from personal life onto a work device.


    2. Malware; the preferred behavior is employees identify what is sent from a trusted source on the company’s network.


    3. To find those who are not in accordance with our preferred behavior for employees we will be sending out pseudo-malicious emails that send us the information on who’s clicking these emails.


    4. SilverCorp’s goal is to identify those who exhibit nonpreferred behavior, train them, and see a 15% reduction in malicious downloads. 


Step 2: Involve the Right People

    1. Chief of Staff;
The chief of staff works to solve issues or settle disputes before it goes up to the CEO. His role will mediate all the communication amongst the management team to get our training into effect. 
    2. Chief of Information;
The CIO determine’s the business side of the IT area. Here, the CIO will be the one approving the final training and emails to be sent to all employees. Also, he will be determining how much of the company’s budget to allocate to this program.
    3. VP of Network Operations;
Oversees the companies daily networking use and operations. Here he will coordinate with his directors in getting pseudo-malicious codes made to identify the employees who are not exhibiting preferred behavior. He will also help coordinate the direction of training the employees will get.
    4. Director of IT;
Oversees the projects that are designed to align with the company’s goals. Here is where the pseudo-malicious emails will be crafted to be sent to all employees. They will oversee changes to the email such as sender, file names, etc. 
    5. Director of Network Security;
Oversees the programs put in place for network security. Here will be where they create a training regiment for the employees not exhibiting preferred behaviors.


Step 3: Training Plan


    1. We will be sending out emails daily, with video-based training occurring at the beginning of the following week for those who clicked our pseudo-malicious emails. For repeat offenders, they will attend a one-hour seminar with both the Director of Network Security.


    2. In the training, we will cover malicious files, what they look like, how to identify phishing, the dangers of malicious files, and real-world examples of malware to create awareness towards their daily habits.


    3. To measure effectiveness we will continuously compare the percentages of employees who click malicious links, to the percentages of employees clicking malicious links after training. We also will keep track of the percentage of employees who repeat offend to help identify effectiveness in training and retraining.


Step 4: Other Solutions

    1. Two Potential Solutions;
A)Encrypting Sensitive Files & B) IP Blocking Noncompany websites


    2. A) Technical control B) Technical control


    3. A) Preventitive control B) detterent


    4. A) The advantage would be that it would be impossible to do anything with the information hidden behind the encryption.
B) The advantage would be that with almost every website blocks, it deters shady website visitation, and deters unproductivity.


    5. A) One disadvantage would be that if a key was lost for a file, the file would remain forever locked behind the encryption.
B) One disadvantage would be that it’s impossible to block every website, and may encourage users to use their own wireless connection, making company information at risk.
