Single credit card information can fetch up to $45 on illegal markets
    7. How did Magecart successfully attack Ticketmaster?

    8. What is one reason why there has been a growth of formjacking? 
The price drop in cryptocurrency, it financially makes more sense to steal things with the most value.

    9. Cryptojacking dropped by what percentage between January and December 2018?
It fell by 52%.

    10. If a web page contains a coinmining script, what happens? 
When visited, it would act like a vampire, slowly syphoning away CPU processing to use towards a greater mining project. 

    11. How does an exploit kit work? 
Almost as the opposite of a scan and fix antivirus usb would. Pre-loaded with exploits to use against a system, simplifies attacking by downloading the system and computing the correct exploits to deploy.

    12. What does the criminal group SamSam specialize in? 
Ransomware attacks, mostly against US Corporations.

    13. How many SamSam attacks did Symantec find evidence of in 2018? 
There was evidence of 67 SamSam attacks reported in 2018.

    14. Even though ransomware attacks declined in 2017-2018, what was one dramatic change that occurred? 
The increase of the use of foam jacking.

    15. In 2018, what was the primary ransomware distribution method? 
Primary distribution for the ransomware was through email, probably due to the 1% ideology; if 1% of the people fall for it they’re in for a pretty penny. 

    16. What operating systems do most types of ransomware attacks still target?
Windows, the largest amount of world users online are on it, so the easiest target to hit the masses.


    17. What are “living off the land” attacks? What is the advantage to hackers? 
Attacks using off the shelf tools and OS features, stuff that already exists in the environment of the system. Advantage is an easy way to stay off the grid and not trigger any alarms.

    18. What is an example of a tool that’s used in “living off the land” attacks?
PowerShell, it’s found in every Windows system b/c it’s a task automation and configuration management framework.

    19. What are zero-day exploits?
Is a recently found exploit for vulnerability that cyber criminals can use to attack systems, and especially dangerous because only the criminal’s aware of it’s existence.

    20. By what percentage did zero-day exploits decline in 2018? 
Down by 4%

    21. What are two techniques that worms such as Emotet and Qakbot use?
Password dumping or brute force attacks

    22. What are supply chain attacks? By how much did they increase in 2018?
Up by 78%, supply chains are attacks that focus on damaging the weaker and less secure parts of the supply networks in an industry.

    23. What challenge do supply chain attacks and living off the land attacks highlight for organizations? 
That they’re very hard to detect because they’re essentially operating from the inside, and focusing on the weakest parts of the system, as if they are almost cancerous. 
“Both supply chain and living off the land attacks highlight the
challenges facing organizations and individuals, with attacks
increasingly arriving through trusted channels, using fileless
attack methods or legitimate tools for malicious purposes.
While we block on average 115,000 malicious PowerShell
scripts each month, this only accounts for less than 1
percent of overall PowerShell usage. Effectively identifying

detection methods such as analytics and machine learning.”


    24. The 20 most active groups tracked by Symantec targeted an average of how many organizations between 2016 and 2018? 
Each group targeted on average 55 organizations; 20 groups x 55 organizations = 1100 average targets.

    25. How many individuals or organizations were indicted for cyber criminal activities in 2018? What are some of the countries that these entities were from? 
49 indictments in 2018, ranging across Russian, Chinese, Iranian, and North Korean nationals. 

    26. When it comes to the increased number of cloud cybersecurity attacks, what is the common theme? 
Exploitation of hardware and misconfigured settings.

    27. What is the implication for successful cloud exploitation that provides access to memory locations that are normally forbidden? 
Since multiple clouds can share memory, it means if you break into one you break into them all. 

    28. What are two examples of the above cloud attack? 
Meltdown and SPectre.
