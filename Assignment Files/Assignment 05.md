I would say the two largest topics I am most excited to experience and learn about in this course
are the exploration of Linux and learning what goes into security, the key to a good offense is a
better defense. For Linux, it’s been something I’ve been around and exposed to, but never had
full confidence to try it out on our family computer growing up. The allure of it was the freedom,
customization, and the shared network of people who care passionately about it, and would
have made my life a lot easier with what I was torrenting and installing. Also raspberry pi’s are a
tool that has interested me for a while, really would love to learn the skills to buy one and go
with it. As for the cybersecurity portion, I played defense in football during high school, and
that’s really what won games; if no schools in the district have scored a touchdown against us,
how confident are they likely to be meeting us on our home field? So I’ll be pretty excited
towards learning the fundamentals and trying to think of real-world applications to them as we
go. I’m also excited to explore more of the networking side of things, tremendously help out my
home life as everyone always asks me to fix things. And I wouldn’t say it’s because I’m a tech
mastermind, it’s really just me googling what’s wrong. This provides me a lot of comfort in the
course, as we’ll be using Google for most of our self problem-solving.

I have currently had no career in this field yet, just simply being able to understand and operate
Linux would start to open a tremendous amount of doors. It’s a little bit of the start,
understanding how systems communicate and coming from kitchen management I truly
understand the importance of communication, on top of being married as well. Communication
is vital to a machine operating successfully, so understanding the communication sides of things
will give me the concept I’m looking for to be able to move on ina field such as cybersecurity.
And then risk assessment and the use of scripts will help familiarize themselves with what to
look out for, like unhealthy communication for example. It’s like saying hello to a coworker and
they grunt, a red flag goes up that something’s off. Similar to if I’m familiar with the way clients
and devices speak to each other, it’ll be easier to identify problems. But at the end of the day,
these are just small chunks of cybersecurity as a whole, but they are where I believe I’ll get my
strongest foundations of concepts for this course, and what I’ll need to take off running in the
field after February.
